      <p class="p">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br> were current, if not more so,
        in the company I joined. I <br> honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</p>
      <br>

      <p class="p1">‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a <br>
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up <br>
        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
        The next 12 <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
        the course, I‚Äôve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

        them and
        learning from their experiences was easy.</p>

      <p class="p4" style="color: gray;">‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The <br>
        program
        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br> myself as a capable
        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the <br>personal attention you need from
        an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p>

      ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from
      professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged <br> to enroll by a former
      student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff -->
